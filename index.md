Hi everyone. 

Understanding mathematical concepts and theory that drive data science practices can sometimes become tricky. People ask is it necessary to go through all this math? A simple answer is Yes. However, it doesn't mean that you should be able to derive or reproduce it, unless you want to write a research paper. Many a times it suffices to have the intuition and know why things work the way they do. I will try to explain the concepts in a simplified fashion as much as possible here. 

You'll need to keep the following files and directories largely unchanged.

    Rakefile
    _includes
    _layouts
    _plugins
    assets/themes

We _will_ change one file within `_includes/`; see below.

### Edit the `_config.yml` file

~~~~~~~~
public class StringFormat { 
	public static void main() {
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}
}
