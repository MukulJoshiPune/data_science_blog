Hi everyone. 

Understanding mathematical concepts and theory that drive data science practices can sometimes become tricky. People ask is it necessary to go through all this math? A simple answer is Yes. However, it doesn't mean that you should be able to derive or reproduce it, unless you want to write a research paper. Many a times it suffices to have the intuition and know why things work the way they do. I will try to explain the concepts in a simplified fashion as much as possible here.
