Objective
---------

Hi everyone. 

Understanding mathematical concepts and theory that drive data science practices can sometimes become tricky. People ask is it necessary to go through all this math? A simple answer is Yes. However, it doesn't mean that you should be able to derive or reproduce it, unless you want to write a research paper. Many a times it suffices to have the intuition and know why things work the way they do. I will try to explain the concepts in a simplified fashion as much as possible here.

*Most of these will in fact turn out to be pointers to some excellent videos or writeups. The idea is not to repeat the work. Also it is always good to give credit where its due :)* 

If you find any interesting pointer that you think will be useful for the fraternity, please email me. Thanks.
