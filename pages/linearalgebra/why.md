Here is a simple understanding of that why. 

* We humans are limited in our capability of understanding :-) however we are capable enough to solve and understand Linear equations. 
* Many of the real world problems are non linear. 
* Even if we use "computers" to solve non linear problems, they would take a "lot of time" to come up with an answer and it will really grow with higher number of unknowns. 
* These non linear problems can be approximated as linear problems. And then we know how to solve them. Even the "computers" can solve them fast.
