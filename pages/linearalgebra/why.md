Here is a simple answer to that why. 

* We humans are limited in our capability of understanding :-) however we are capable enough to solve and understand Linear equations. 
* Many of the real world problems are non linear. 
* Even if we use "computers" to solve non linear problems, they would take a "lot of time" to come up with an answer and it will really grow with higher number of unknowns. 
* These non linear problems can be approximated as linear problems. And then we know how to solve them. Even the "computers" can solve them fast.

In Data Science, you typically work with features of the data. Feature is an individual measurable property of your data points/objects. And hence you can represent your data as a **feature vector**. For example, consider spam detection. Each of your email can have a feature vector comprising of its few headers, email size, structure, frequency of specific terms, lanuage used, grammatical correctness etc. So you can now imagine the data as "multiple data points" each having its own corresponding feature vector. Does it sound like a matrix? You can consider each feature dimension as a basis vector and you now have your data points as vectors in a multi-dimensional vector space. The toolbox to deal with it now is Linear Algebra. 

Lets take **another example**, social network or web. It basically has a graph structure. Where friendship or hyperlink is the edge connecting people or pages. How do you represent a graph as a data structure ? An adjacency matrix. You now need Linear Algebra again. 

These are just very simple examples. Just remember, there is not much moving ahead without understanding Linear Algebra at basic level. If you are still in doubt and have a lot of time to understand where engineers and scientists use it, go through [this reditt thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ozkcv/whats_the_point_of_linear_algebra/)

However if you take a bit of efforts and gain a better understanding you will enjoy your data science journey as a lot of math will be clear to you. If you want to work deep in data science research and your goal is to write a machine learning research paper some day, understanding it at an Expert level is a must.
